## Overview
This is a website that I made for a project in AP Literature where we create a visualization of the concept of invisiblility from Raplh Ellison's Invisible Man. I decided to make a website that shows how the way people appear changes when you look at them through different lenses.

## User Instructrions
#### Switching modes
1. Click the button in the top left to switch between the premade and custom mode

#### Premade mode
1. Click the boxes above the canvas to load the different POVs
2. This will create a circle that goes left and right over the man
3. Depending on the POV, the man will be colored differently when it passes over him.
    1. This will correspond to the color legend on the right
4. Click the + and - buttons to increase and decrease the circle size
5. Click stop simulation to stop the animation

#### Custom mode
1. Click the boxes above the canvas to load the different POVs
2. This will create a circle that can be dragged to anywhere on the canvas
    1. you can spawn mutliple circles at once in this mode
3. Depending on the POV, the man will be colored differently when it is over him.
    1. This will correspond to the color legend on the right
4. Click the + and - buttons to increase and decrease the circle size
5. Click stop simulation to stop the animation

## Recreation Instructions
1. This should copy over relatively easily
## Special aspects
1. This program is optimized as much as possible for speed
    1. I made two programs rendering from the circles and rendering through the image to find the fastest method
