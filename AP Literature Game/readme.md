## Overview
As the final project for my AP Literature Class, we were tasked to display the answer to the question: **What is great literature?**

We could do anything for this project, and since I wanted to utilize my computer science skills and have always wanted to make a game from scratch, I decided to make this. My answer to this question is that literary devices help make novels more interesting and impactful, but it is an impactful theme that makes a work "great literature."

This game has four levels and can be played in any order, but I reccomend playing them in order. The first three levels demonstrate their literary devices while the last level demonstrates how an impactful theme is all that matters

## User Instructrions
1. Opening the website will bring you to the main menu of the game
2. Click the level you want to play (I recomend going left to right and top to bottom)
3. move left and right with a and d
4. jump with space
5. Play through the level and the teacher/wizard will explain the importance of the level at the end
6. Once back at the menu, choose the next level to play and enjoy the new upgrade you got.

## Recreation Instructions
1. This should copy over relatively easily, however, there is a chance the images (stored on codehs) will not transfer correctly

## Special aspects
1. The game engine for this code is made completely from scratch and can easily have more levels added to it
2. I took a large chance in displaying such an abstract idea with a custom computer game while I could have done anything else for this project
3. The entire canvas and game is scalable, along with the text, so resizing the window should not mess up the game
    1. This is why coordinates are stored as percentages rather than hard coded pixels
